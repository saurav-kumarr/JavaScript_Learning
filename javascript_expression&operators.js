// EXPRESSION
// An expression in javascript is any valid unit code that procedures a value

 //--> let a = , 3+3 (it is a expression)

// LATERAL
// A literal is fixed value that you write directly in the code

 //--> 30, "javascript", true (They are all lateral)

// OPERATORS
// Operators in javaScript are symbols that perform operations on operands.

 //--> +, -, /, * (They are all operators)
